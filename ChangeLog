Stable version 8.0.1 released (Sept 30 2017)

   Bug fixes

     * Transit View: the time input field doesn't work properly. Time has
       sometimes a difference of 12 hours after entering the data.
       Workaround: enter time first and then date.
     * Uranian View/yearly preview: event date of pair events (p1=p2) is
       not okay. Date is calculated from the end of the year instead of
       beginning. Does not affect triple events: midpoints, reflection
       points, sums, differences.
     * Page header in printouts, multipage printouts (Vedic comprehensive)
       do not reflect the horoscope data (name, date etc.). A new chart is
       used instead. Calculations in printout are correct nevertheless.

   Changes

     * Mac OS X: new build with wxWidgets upgrade to version 3.0.3 and 64
       bit architecture.
